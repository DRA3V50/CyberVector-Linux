# CyberVector
CyberVector is a Linux based cyber biothreat analysis and containment initiative focused on modeling host compromise, studying propagation behavior, and validating defensive response controls within Ubuntu environments.
This repository documents structured exposure simulations using real world tooling to evaluate authentication resilience, persistence mechanisms, privilege escalation paths, and host level security posture. The objective is to investigate compromise patterns, implement containment measures, and verify control effectiveness through repeatable testing.
CyberVector treats cyber intrusions as controlled exposure events, applying a containment lifecycle inspired by real world incident response and infrastructure protection programs.
